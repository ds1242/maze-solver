# A Maze Solver

This creates a board set in the main function and fills the board with cells.  It then 
removes the walls to randomly to create a maze.  After the maze has been created it uses 
depth first search to traverse through the maze creating a read line on moves into a new cell.
If it hits a wall and turns back the line is turned gray while it searchs it's way through the
the maze.


### Future Plans
Add user input for the size of the maze
Add user input for the random number to change the shape of the maze
